### Additions

- Energy - 50% chance spawn per level
- Changed color of ship
- Decrease range of laser
- Added "R" Increase range of laser
- Added "Pause"

### Ideas
- Create more power-ups: rapid fire, spread, temporary invincibility, grenade, faster boost.
- Create negative power-ups: same use lower case "r" vs "R" for laser
- Add purchase options: after 5 levels get store level where you can trade points for power-ups.
- Leaderboard - 3 character - Top 10 saved to DB on Firebase...
- On game over ability to post to Twitter.

### Changes
